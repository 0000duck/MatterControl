<!-- 🚨 STOP 🚨 𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗣 🚨 𝑺𝑻𝑶𝑷 🚨 -->

<!--
Before filing, check if the issue already exists (either open or closed) by using the search bar on the issues page. If it does, comment on the original issue. Even if it's closed, we can reopen it based on your comment.

Please COMPLETELY fill in the information below. The template is designed to avoid unnecessary delays to confirm and fix reported issues. Issues with missing information generally end up with a `need-info` label and take significantly more time to fix. Please help us help you!

**MatterControl Build Number**
<!-- Example: 2.0.0-9999. To find this, go to the MatterControl menu in the top left and click "About MatterControl" -->

**Operating System Version**
<!-- Examples: Windows 10, macOS 10.14, Ubuntu 18.10, Android -->

**Printer Make/Model**

**Steps to Reproduce**
<!--
Describe how to make the bug happen. Fixing a bug depends on the developers being able to get it to happen themselves, on their computer. Start at the very beginning (opening MatterControl) and explain exactly what you did leading to the issue, step by step. Follow the steps yourself and make sure that you can get the issue to happen again. If it is difficult to explain, then you are encouraged to include screenshots or a screen recording. You can do this using a tool like ScreenToGif (https://www.screentogif.com/). If the problem is related to a particular file you are working with, include it in the next section.

**Attachments**
<!--
Include any of the files below which may be related to your issue. These are necessary in order for the developers to recreate and diagnose your problem. If in doubt, upload as many of these as possible. It is better for us to have too much information than too little. You may have to pack them in a .zip in order to upload them to GitHub.

* Model you are trying to print
<!-- This may be an STL file or a design you created in MatterControl. If you made it in MatterControl, export it as a ZIP file. -->
* Printer Settings File
<!-- A lot of the behavior in MatterControl is related to your printer configuration. To export your settings, go to the three dots menu in the top right of MatterControl (next to the hot end controls) and choose "Export All Settings". -->
* Print Log
<!--
This log details all the communications between MatterControl and your printer. It is helpful for diagnosing hardware/firmware errors and communications issues.

    1. Run a print as you normally would.
    2. Once the problem occurs, open the G-Code terminal by going to Options > Show Terminal.
    3. Click the 'Export' button at the bottom of the screen.
    4. Save the print log.
